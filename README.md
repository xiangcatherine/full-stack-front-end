This app is a simple, fun pregnancy tracker. Becoming a new mother is daunting - my
sister is expecting and uses 2-3 apps daily to help her keep track of her
symptoms, how her baby is growing, what food she should eat etc. I was inspired
by that!

The mother-to-be inputs how far along she is and receives a estimate of how her
baby is currently (e.g. "Baby is now as big as a ukelele!"). When she signs back in
after a certain amount of time, the age and size of her baby are updated accordingly.
